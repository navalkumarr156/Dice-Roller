# Dice-Roller

A simple Python program that simulates rolling a dice. Each time the user chooses to roll, the program randomly selects one of the six dice faces and displays it using Unicode dice symbols.

ðŸ“‚ How It Works

1. The program asks if you want to roll the dice.

2. If you type y, it randomly prints one dice face.

3.If you type n, the program ends.
